# Get ready to take the course

We hope that you are excited to get started with the course, and we have designed this page to make sure you have
everything you need to jump right in!

## Step 1. Sign up

To stay up to date with all the updates and special social events, sign up to the course.

## Step 2. Get a Hugging Face account

If you don't yet have one, create a Hugging Face account (it's free). You'll need it to complete hands-on tasks, to
receive your certificate of completion, to explore pre-trained models, to access datasets and more.

## Step 3. Brush up on fundamentals (if you need to)

We assume that you are familiar with deep learning basics, and have general familiarity with transformers. If you need
to brush up on your understanding of transformers, check out our [NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)

## Step 4. Check your setup

To go through the course materials you will need:
- A computer with an internet connection
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for hands-on exercises. The free version is enough.

If you have never used Google Colab before, check out this [official introduction notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

## Step 6. Join the community
<!--  TODO: add link to Discord -->
We invite you to join our vibrant and supportive community on Discord. You will have the opportunity to connect with
like-minded learners, exchange ideas, and get valuable feedback on your hands-on exercises. You can ask questions,
share resources, and collaborate with others.

Our team is also active on Discord, and they are available to provide support and guidance when you need
it. Joining our community is an excellent way to stay motivated, engaged, and connected, and we look forward to seeing
you there!
