# Automatic speech recognition with a pipeline

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a task that involves transcribing speech audio recording into text.
This task has has numerous practical applications, from creating closed captions for videos to enabling voice commands
for virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

ASR is a multimodal task that relies on audio signals and language context to transcribe speech. The multimodal nature
of ASR makes it a challenging task, as it requires integrating and processing multiple modalities of input. This is where
sequence-to-sequence transformer models have demonstrated significant advancements. These models can learn to combine
different modalities of input and extract meaningful representations that capture the nuances of speech and language.

In this section, we'll use the `automatic-speech-recognition` pipeline to transcribe an audio recording of a person
asking a question about paying a bill using the same MINDS-14 dataset as before.

Load the dataset and upsample it to 16kHz as described in [Audio classification with a pipeline](audio_applications.mdx),
if you haven't done that yet.

To transcribe an audio recording, we can use the `automatic-speech-recognition` pipeline from ðŸ¤— Transformers. Let's
instantiate the pipeline:

```python
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> asr = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition")
```

Take an example from the dataset and pass its raw data to the pipeline:

```py
>>> example = minds[0]
>>> asr(example["audio"]["array"])
{'text': 'I WOULD LIKE TO PAY MY ELECTRICITY BILL USING MY COD CAN YOU PLEASE ASSIST'}
```

Let's compare to what the actual transcription for this example is:

```py
>>> example['english_transcription']
'I would like to pay my electricity bill using my card can you please assist'
```

The model seems to have done a pretty good job at transcribing the audio! It only got one word wrong ("card") compared
to the original transcription, which is pretty good considering the speaker has an Australian accent, where the letter "r"
is often silent. Having said that, I wouldn't recommend trying to pay your next electricity bill with a fish!

By default, this pipeline uses a model trained for automatic speech recognition for English language, which is fine in
this example. If you'd like to try transcribing other subsets of MINDS-14 in different language, you can find a pre-trained
ASR model [on the ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition&language=fr&sort=downloads).
You can filter the models list by task first, then by language. Once you have found the model you like, pass it's name as
the `model` argument to the pipeline.

When working on solving your own task, starting with a simple pipeline like the ones we've shown in this unit is a valuable
tool that offers several benefits:
- a pre-trained model may exist that already solves your task really well, saving you plenty of time
- if the result isn't ideal, this still gives you a quick baseline for future fine-tuning
- once you fine-tune a model on your custom data and share it on Hub, the whole community will be able to use it quickly
and effortlessly via the `pipeline()` method making AI more accessible.
